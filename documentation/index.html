                <p>You will be using your code in 6 months, code that you wrote 6 months ago is often indistinguishable from code that someone else has written. You will look upon a file with a fond sense of remembrance. Then a sneaking feeling of foreboding, knowing that someone less experienced, less wise, had written it.</p>
                <p>As you go through this selfless act of untangling things that were obvious or clever months ago, you will start to empathize with your users. If only I had written down why I had done this. Life would be so much simpler. Documentation allows you to transfer the why behind code. Much in the same way code comments explain the why, and not the how, documentation serves the same purpose.</p>

                <p>You have written a piece of code, and released it into the world. You have done this because you think that others might find it useful. However, people need to understand why your code might be useful for them, before they decide to use it. Documentation tells people that this project is for them.</p>
                <p>There are a small number of people who will source dive and use any code out there. That is a vanishingly small number of people, compared to people who will use your code when properly documented. If you really love your project, document it, and let other people use it.</p>

                <p>Open source is this magical thing right? You release code, and the code gnomes come and make it better for you.</p>
                <p>Not quite.</p>
                <p>There are lots of ways that open source is amazing, but it doesn’t exist outside the laws of physics. You have to put work in, to get work out.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You only get contributions after you have put in a lot of work.</li>
                    <li>You only get contributions after you have users.</li>
                    <li>You only get contributions after you have documentation.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Documentation also provides a platform for your first contributions. A lot of people have never contributed before, and documentation changes are a lot less scary than code changes. If you don’t have documentation, you will miss out on a whole class of contributors.</p>

                <p>It’s really easy to have an idea in your head that sounds perfect, but the act of putting words to paper requires a distillation of thought that may not be so easy.</p>
                <p>Writing documentation improves the design of your code. Talking through your API and design decisions on paper allows you to think about them in a more formalized way. A nice side effect is that it allows people to contribute code that follows your original intentions as well.</p>

            <article class="textarea">
                <p>Writing documentation is a different form of writing than most people have experience with. Technical writing is an art that doesn’t come naturally. Writing documentation will start you down the road to being a better technical writer, which is a useful skill to have as a programmer.</p>
                <p>Writing also becomes easier over time. If you don’t write for many months, it is a lot harder to start writing again. Keeping your projects documented will keep you writing at a reasonable cadence.</p>
                <p>Starting simple is the best way to achieve actual results. I will present a well-paved path to walk down, and after you have the basic idea, you can expand your scope. The tools should be powerful and easy to use. This removes obstacles to actually putting words on the page.</p>

                <p>As programmers we live in a world of plain text. Our documentation tooling should be no exception. We want tools that turn plain text into pretty HTML. We also have some of the best tooling available for tracking changes to files. Why would we forgo using those tools when writing documentation? This workflow is powerful, and familiar to developers.</p>

* Online documentation: http://docs.writethedocs.org/

This will render into a header, with a list underneath it. The URLs will be hyperlinked automatically. It’s easy to write, still makes sense as plain text, and renders nicely into HTML.

                <p>First, you need to ask yourself who you’re writing for. At first, you generally just need to appeal to two audiences:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Users</li>

                <p>Users are people who simply want to use your code, and don’t care how it works. Developers are people who want to contribute back to your code.</p>

                <p>A lot of people will come to your docs trying to figure out what exactly your project is. Someone will mention it, or they’ll google a phrase randomly. You should explain what your project does and why it exists. Fabric does a great job of this.</p>

                <p>A lot of people have the same problems. If things happen all the time, you should probably fix your documentation or the code, so that the problems go away. However, there are always questions that get asked about your project, things that can’t be changed, etc. Document those, and keep it up to date. FAQs are generally out of date, but when done well, they are a golden resource. Tastypie did a great job with this, with their “Cookbook” concept.</p>

                <p>People usually have standards for how they expect things to be done in their projects. You should document these so that if people write code, they can do things in the norm of the project. Open Comparison does a great job of this.</p>

Hopefully your install instructions should be a couple lines for the basic case. A page that gives more information and caveats should be linked from here if necessary.

                    Use two asterisks (<code>**text**</code>) for bolding
                    Use two backticks (<code>``text``</code>) for code samples.
                    Links to external sites contain the link text and a bracketed URL in backticks, followed by an underscore: <code>`Link to Write the Docs <https://www.writethedocs.org/>`_ </code>. </p> <p>Headers are demarcated by non-alphanumeric characters like dashes, equal signs, or tildes. Use the same character for headers at the same level. The following creates a header:
                            <pre><code>===============
Chapter 1
===============
</code></pre>
                            If inserted in the same document, this creates a header at a different level:
                            <pre><code>Section 1.1
------------------
</code></pre>
                            Having an underline-only is acceptable, as is having both an underline and an overline. If you use the same non-alphanumeric character for underline-only and underline-and-overline headers, they will be considered to be at different levels.</p>
                The row of non-alphanumeric characters should have at least as long as the header text.
                <p>For enumerated lists, use a number or letter followed by a period, or followed by a right-bracket, or surrounded by brackets:
                    <pre><code>1. Use this format the numbers in your list like 1., 2., etc.

A. To make items in your list go like A., B., etc. Both uppercase and lowercase letters are acceptable.

I. Roman numerals are also acceptable, uppercase or lowercase.

(1) Numbers in brackets are acceptable.

1) So are numbers followed by a bracket.

                <p>For bulleted lists, use indentation to indicate the level of nesting of a bullet point. You can use -, +, or * as a bullet point character:
                    <pre><code>* Bullet point

  - nested bullet point

    + even more nested bullet point

                    To display code samples, or any text that should not be formatted, end the paragraph prior to the code sample with two colons (::) and indent the code sample:
